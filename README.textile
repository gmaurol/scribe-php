h2. Welcome to the home of Scribe, the simple OAuth PHP lib!

h1. Why use Scribe?

Scribe is proven to be the most straightforward and reliable OAuth library for java, (written by Pablo Fernandez) so I decided to port it to PHP. 

h3. Dead Simple 

Who said OAuth was difficult? Configuring scribe is __so easy your grandma can do it__! check it out:

@$builder = new ServiceBuilder();@
@$service = $builder->provider(new TwitterApi())@
    @->apiKey(YOUR_API_KEY)@
    @->apiSecret(YOUR_API_SECRET)@
    @->build();@
                                  
h3. Supports all major 1.0a and 2.0 OAuth APIs out-of-the-box

* Google

* Facebook

* Yahoo

* LinkedIn

* Twitter

* Foursquare

* Evernote

* Vimeo

* Yammer

* Windows Live

* and many more!

h3. Small and modular

Scribe's code is small and simple to understand. No smart-ass or "clever" hacks here.

h3. Stable & bulletproof

Good test coverage to keep you safe from harm. 

When something bad actually happens, Scribe's meaningful error messages will tell you exactly what went wrong, when and where.
